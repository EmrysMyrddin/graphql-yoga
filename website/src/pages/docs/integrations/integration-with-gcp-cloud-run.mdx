# Integration with Google Cloud Platform

Google Cloud Run is a Platform as a Service by Google.
It is straightforward to use Yoga with it.

## Prerequisites

You will first need to install GCP command line tool : `gcloud`. [You can find instructions here](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).

If you already had `gcloud` installed, make sure it is up to date with `gcloud components update`

[Create a new project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects) and make sure [billing is enabled](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/verify-billing-enabled)

## Installation

Create a new Node project and add Yoga to it's dependencies.

<PackageCmd packages={['graphql', 'graphql-yoga']} />

<Callout>
  This example uses ESM syntax, so you set `"type": "module"` in your
  `package.json`.
</Callout>

Add a `start` script to your `package.json`. Cloud Run needs to know how to start your application.

```json
{
  "name": "graphql-yoga-cloud-run-guide",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "module",
  "main": "src/index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node ."
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "graphql": "^16.6.0",
    "graphql-yoga": "^3.9.1"
  }
}
```

## Usage

Create a graphql server with your schema. You can use any http server, here we will need node's http implementation.

```js
import { createSchema, createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'
import { createServer } from 'node:http'

const yoga = createYoga({
  schema: createSchema({
    typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
      type Query {
        greetings: String
      }
    `,
    resolvers: {
      Query: {
        greetings: () =>
          'This is the `greetings` field of the root `Query` type'
      }
    }
  })
})

const server = createServer(yoga)
const port = parseInt(process.env.PORT) || 4000

server.listen(port, () => {
  console.info(
    `Server is running on http://localhost:${port}${yoga.graphqlEndpoint}`
  )
})
```

You can now deploy to Cloud Run using. You can use all default value, except the last one which allow unauthenticated access to your service.

```bash
$ gcloud run deploy --source .
```

<Callout>
  If this is your first time using Cloud Run, the enabling of the service can
  take up to few minutes to really be effective. If you have some `403
  Forbidden` errors, just wait 2 minutes and try again.
</Callout>

You can now access to your API using the url given by `gcloud`. The default graphlq endpoint is `/graphql`.

It is also possible to use Typescript or any other tool requiring a build phase (such as codegen).
Add a Dockerfile to the root of your project so that Cloud Run build a custom image for you.
